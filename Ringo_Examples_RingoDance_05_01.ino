Version 5.1 9/2015


This sketch showcases several possible Ringo behaviors.
Use these behaviors as starting points for your own work.
When reset or turned on, press one of the number keys on your
IR remote control to activate one of the behaviors. If Ringo
blinks red, then the key was not recognized. If Ringo blinks
green, then the key was recognized and a beavior has
been started.
